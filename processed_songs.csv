It was twenty-five past nine at night and I was really bored
So I sat down with my guitar, but I needed some new chords
I spoke to my good friend called Chas, he was an indie boy
With skinny jeans and vintage shoes and hair all over the shop
And he said, ""Oh girl, just use a good chord combination
That will make the boys go goo-goo eyed
And give them inspiration, honey
You need a sweet and simple melody that you can sing along to
An indie tune that'll make the girls swoon
That a raver boy can dance to""
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
I said, ""It sounds okay""
He said, ""Of course it does, you're a magician on guitar""
I said, ""thank you, love
I'm not that great and I wouldn't go that far""
I've got this friend called Paul and his brain ain't small
He played the violin
But now he's a rocker, a leather jacket shocker

Nothing says tomorrow is a guarantee
There’s no way of knowing that you’ll be with me
As I walk upon the edge of no escape in a world so flat
And then it hits me like a bolt of faith
I love you, not-nothing else

I always wanted you

What do I do to lock you up inside my heart?
I wanted you from the start

I hold your heartbeat in my hand
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again
I lose my grip and start to drown
Still see your feet from underground
You are getting away
Again, again, again, again, again
It feels like I'm in a glass box
Invisible cape is on top
Keep on confessing your love for
Some other girl you would rather
I feel like a ghost in a white room
Your eyes keep starin' at me straight through
Only not to be two hearts goin' blind
One, two, three, so I kissed goodbye and left the room
Don't break my heart
This is when I lose my balance
This is when I lose all control
This is when I find the challenge
The challenge I can call my own
It's hard to fight a battle
When all my weapons are so far
Out of reach and balance
And I forget who you are

Uh, uh, Brooke Candy
We were on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
Kept the blunts rolled, always let you take the first hit
When the feds caught us, I said I would take the rap
'Cause I knew it ain't easy livin' life in the trap
I was the Queen B and you were like my Jay Z
Only one who held me down when I was fuckin' crazy
Ivana and Trump, shit, we coulda ran the world
You were my Chris Brown, I was your only girl
Let you put your feet up while I was cookin' you breakfast
Thought I found my ride or die, but now I just regret shit
Log into your email 'cause I knew that shit was wrong
Pullin' up a private photo of a bitch showin' her thong
Then I look a lil' closer, it's my home girl Lisa
Time to terminate shit, hasta la vista
Married to the mob, so I put a hit on it
Handed you my heart, then you took a shit on it

Think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real
No, I ain't changing
Wish I could surrender, give you everything I got
And let you know
It's something 'bout the way you move me
Yeah, yeah
It's something 'bout the way you save my life
Something 'bout the way you
Hold my body tight even on my lowest nights
Locked down by my side
Even when I'm borderline
Yeah, I don't even know why I push you away
It's something 'bout the way you
Call it what you want, I got a habit for destruction
Take all of your trust and then betray it like it's nothing
Yeah, I think it's in my soul, the way I run from something real and leave you wondering (Wondering)
Why I can't surrender, give you everything I got and let you know

Chemistry something like magic
You were with somebody else long term

And in the morning we got coffee
Acting like strangers, and told no friends
It wasn't easy to pretend
And we know that it's wrong, but it feels real fun
Sneakin' around, fallin' deep in love
But sometimes I get scared
'Cause I know it's unfair
I'm hurting someone else instead

Cigarettes up on the balcony
Wrapped up in nothing but sheets

Calling too much, you're breaking my phone
Mad when you do and sad when you don't
Chivalry, ooh, you taking my coat
Too cute, no, this ain't me now
Candlelight, out on a starry night
You brush my hair to the side
And you tell me I'm pretty

Cheeks so red when the blood starts rushing
Yuck, that boy's so mushy
Sending me flowers, I'm just tryna get lucky

Fuck, going all lovey-dovey on me
